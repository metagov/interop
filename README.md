# RFP: Interoperable Deliberative Tools
<p align="center">

</p>

**Purpose**: To support new and existing tools for deliberation and governance, and to promote more interoperability between such tools.

**Scope**: Digital tools that go beyond basic voting and commenting, and provide new capabilities to the governance ecosystem—which may only be one step of a larger deliberative governance process. The processes these tools enable may be used for online community governance, AI governance and alignment, cooperative governance, citizen town halls or assemblies, or other kinds of institutional policy-making or decision-making.

**Interoperability requirement**: as a key condition of the grant, all grantees must support interoperability by incorporating a process to publish their data in a flatfile format such as JSON, JSON-LD, or CSV as well as a process to import data into their tool from a flatfile. This requirement is described more fully in the [draft interoperability specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-2OVyJIvVTcQLPCg_mA3UzohSGZUm9dHPyWKwK4LlA/edit) and rationale accompanying this RFP.

## Funded projects
We awarded approximately $200,000 to 14 projects, out of 51 applications received. Additionally, seven project teams whose projects were not selected have been invited to attend the cohort meetings, supported by a small stipend. We will also be conducting an in person workshop in San Francisco for all of the cohort members to convene and collaborate.
